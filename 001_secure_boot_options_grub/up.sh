    # A kernel pointer points to a specific location in kernel memory. These can be very useful in exploiting the
    # kernel, but kernel pointers are not hidden by default â€” it is easy to uncover them by, for example, reading
    # the contents of /proc/kallsyms. This setting aims to mitigate kernel pointer leaks. Alternatively, you can
    # set kernel.kptr_restrict=1 to only hide kernel pointers from processes without the CAP_SYSLOG capability.
    "kernel.kptr_restrict=2"

    # dmesg is the kernel log. It exposes a large amount of useful kernel debugging information, but this can often leak
    # sensitive information, such as kernel pointers. Changing the above sysctl restricts the kernel log to the
    # CAP_SYSLOG capability.
    "kernel.dmesg_restrict=1"

    # Despite the value of dmesg_restrict, the kernel log will still be displayed in the console during boot.
    # Malware that is able to record the screen during boot may be able to abuse this to gain higher privileges.
    # This option prevents those information leaks. This must be used in combination with certain boot parameters
    # described below to be fully effective.
    #

    # command will not work as it will leave behind the last 3 3's.

    # documented above.

    # eBPF exposes quite large attack surface. As such, it must be restricted. These sysctls restrict eBPF to the

    # as constant blinding.
    "kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=1"
    "net.core.bpf_jit_harden=2"

    # This restricts loading TTY line disciplines to the CAP_SYS_MODULE capability to prevent unprivileged attackers
    # from loading vulnerable line disciplines with the TIOCSETD ioctl, which has been abused in a number of exploits
    # before.
    "dev.tty.ldisc_autoload=0"

    # The userfaultfd() syscall is often abused to exploit use-after-free flaws. Due to this, this sysctl is used to
    # restrict this syscall to the CAP_SYS_PTRACE capability.
    "vm.unprivileged_userfaultfd=0"

    # kexec is a system call that is used to boot another kernel during runtime. This functionality can be abused to
    # load a malicious kernel and gain arbitrary code execution in kernel mode, so this sysctl disables it.
    "kernel.kexec_load_disabled=1"

    # The SysRq key exposes a lot of potentially dangerous debugging functionality to unprivileged users. Contrary to
    # common assumptions, SysRq is not only an issue for physical attacks, as it can also be triggered remotely. The
    # value of this sysctl makes it so that a user can only use the secure attention key, which will be necessary for
    # accessing root securely. Alternatively, you can simply set the value to 0 to disable SysRq completely.
    "kernel.sysrq=4"

    # User namespaces are a feature in the kernel which aim to improve sandboxing and make it easily accessible for
    # unprivileged users. However, this feature exposes significant kernel attack surface for privilege escalation,
    # so this sysctl restricts the usage of user namespaces to the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability. For unprivileged
    # sandboxing, it is instead recommended to use a setuid binary with little attack surface to minimise the
    # potential for privilege escalation. This topic is covered further in the sandboxing section.
    #
    # Be aware though that this sysctl only exists on certain Linux distributions, as it requires a kernel patch.
    # If your kernel does not include this patch, you can alternatively disable user namespaces completely
    # (including for root) by setting user.max_user_namespaces=0.
    "kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=0"

    # Performance events add considerable kernel attack surface and have caused abundant vulnerabilities. This sysctl
    # restricts all usage of performance events to the CAP_PERFMON capability
    # (CAP_SYS_ADMIN on kernel versions prior to 5.8).
    #
    # Be aware that this sysctl also requires a kernel patch that is only available on certain distributions.
    # Otherwise, this setting is equivalent to kernel.perf_event_paranoid=2, which only restricts a subset of this
    # functionality.

    # This implies module.sig_enforce=1.
